# AA-assignment4
 
For this assignment I took my original AA game and attempted to add a number of features. 

1. Successfully added an inputField to the intro scene where the player will enter their name and it will appear in the following scene
2. Added instructions on how to play to the intro scene.
3. Attempted to add a high score. The current score will display but I was unable to get the high score to work.
4. Rounds played was added to the main scene though it adds in increments of 2.
5. An explosion sound was added to the collision detection.
6. I was unable to get the scores to appear on the exit scene
